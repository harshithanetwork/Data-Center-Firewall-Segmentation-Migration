## ‚úÖ Project 2 ‚Äî Data Center Firewall Segmentation & Migration

### üß≠ Overview

Led the end-to-end execution of a **large-scale data center migration**, modernizing the network's segmentation strategy and security architecture. Implemented **Cisco ACI** for application-centric segmentation, transitioned legacy ASA and Checkpoint firewall rules to **next-generation firewalls (NGFWs)** including **Fortinet** and **Palo Alto**, and enforced **Zero Trust** security posture for east-west traffic control.

Delivered detailed **High-Level Designs (HLD)** and **Low-Level Designs (LLD)**, performed phased cutovers with application owners, and validated segmentation policies using **SolarWinds**, **Wireshark**, and **packet tracer logs** ‚Äî all while ensuring full compliance with **PCI-DSS** and **NIST 800-53** standards.

### üß± Architecture & Execution

- **ACI Fabric Setup**:
  - Deployed multi-pod **Cisco ACI fabric** with **Leaf-Spine architecture**.
  - Configured **Bridge Domains (BDs)**, **EPGs**, and **Contracts** for micro-segmentation.
  - Integrated **firewall clusters** in routed mode at the edge.

- **Security Policy Migration**:
  - Extracted over **500+ existing firewall rules** from ASA/Checkpoint.
  - Used **API-based rule migration** into **Panorama** and **FortiManager**.
  - Applied **policy deduplication logic** to eliminate shadowed and redundant rules.

- **Segmentation Enforcement**:
  - Adopted **Zero Trust principles** with explicit allow contracts between EPGs.
  - Implemented **tag-based policies** tied to application tiers (Web/App/DB).
  - Ensured segmentation for regulatory zones (DMZ, PCI, Corp, Dev).

- **Operational Hardening**:
  - Validated traffic pre- and post-migration using **packet captures** and **NetFlow**.
  - Integrated **SolarWinds** for real-time traffic visualization and flow anomalies.
  - Collaborated with 30+ application teams for cutover readiness and rollback plans.

### üìä Metrics & Outcomes

| KPI | Result |
|-----|--------|
| Firewall Rules Migrated | 500+ |
| Downtime During Cutover | **Zero** |
| Redundant Rules Removed | **~35% of total rules** |
| PCI/NIST Compliance Status | **100% compliant** |
| Post-Cutover Validation | 100% success rate (no business impact) |

### üß© Challenges & Resolutions

- **Challenge**: Policy duplication & conflicting ACLs across multiple firewalls.
  - ‚úÖ **Resolution**: Used regex parsing + Python script to normalize rulebase and remove redundancies.

- **Challenge**: Unexpected application flows not accounted for in firewall matrix.
  - ‚úÖ **Resolution**: Captured live traffic pre-migration using SPAN/Wireshark and updated matrix iteratively.

- **Challenge**: Slow app response post-ACI cutover due to incorrect BD flooding scope.
  - ‚úÖ **Resolution**: Tuned **L2 Unknown Unicast Flooding** and **ARP Glean** settings in ACI fabric.
